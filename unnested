# Insert some values into our table. Here is a work-around with nested structs.
# Assumme we want to insert some values so that they look like this:


# product    "Ozim_drug",
# department STRUCT<Project: "phase1",id: 054>,
# manager    STRUCT<fname: "Great", lname: "Sopo", id:0062>

Insert into unnested_struct
select 
"Ozim_drug",
named_struct("Project","phase1","id",054),
named_struct("fname","Great","lname","Sopo","id",0062)
from (select 's') t;

# NOTE! I tried and it does work only on Hive. Not Impala.
